# Enhanced Journal: Chat-GPT Inspired Journal Sessions 

Based off this [article](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-3-is-the-best-journal-you-ve-ever-used), I wanted to create a piece of software that felt like a journal and therapy session combined into one. 

Right now, the web app acts as an interative journal; the user types in how they are feeling, and the the website repsonds back with relevang questions to keep the user inspired. If you hit "Save Entry," it stores the current entry with the date to a database in Firebase. 

Here is a sample video of the current prototype:

2. To run the app, run `npm run dev.`
